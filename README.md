# Twitter Streaming API in Python
A Jupyter notebook example demonstrating the use of the Python library [Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/), in a Jupyter notebook, to access the real-time Twitter Streaming API. The notebook demonstrates how to access tweets based on user IDs, search terms or by geolocation.

In order to use the Twitter Streaming API you will need to [Apply for a Twitter Developer Account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/application/use-case). You will then need to set up a Twitter appand obtain the authentication credentials that will enable your application to connect to the API. See [Twitter developer apps: Overview](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/apps/overview) for further details.
